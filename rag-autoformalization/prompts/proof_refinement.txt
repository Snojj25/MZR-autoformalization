You previously attempted to generate a proof for this theorem, but the Lean 4 compiler reported errors.

{proof_examples}

Original Theorem Statement:
{formal_statement}

Previous Proof Attempt:
{previous_attempt}

Compiler Errors:
{compiler_errors}

IMPORTANT: Only change the proof part. Do NOT modify the theorem statement itself. Keep the exact same statement declaration and only fix the proof tactics.

Please fix the errors and generate a corrected proof. Focus on:
1. Syntax errors in the proof tactics
2. Type mismatches in the proof
3. Incorrect tactic usage
4. Missing tactics or tactic combinations
5. Follow the patterns from the examples above

Output ONLY the complete theorem with the corrected proof (keep the statement exactly the same, only change the proof):
