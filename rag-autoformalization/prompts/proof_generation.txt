Generate a Lean 4 proof for this theorem:

{formal_statement}

{proof_examples}

{failed_attempts_note}

IMPORTANT: Only change the proof part (replace 'sorry' with actual tactics). Do NOT modify the theorem statement itself. Keep the exact same statement declaration and only provide the proof.

Output the complete theorem with proof. Use appropriate Lean 4 tactics to construct the proof. Follow the patterns from the examples above.
