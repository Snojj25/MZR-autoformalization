Original Problem: {natural_language}

Previous Attempt:

Compiler Errors:
{compiler_errors}

Please fix the errors and generate a corrected Lean 4 statement (use 'sorry' for the proof). Focus on:
1. Syntax errors (missing tokens, incorrect structure)
2. Type mismatches
3. Unknown identifiers (use correct Mathlib imports)
4. Follow the pattern from the examples above

Output ONLY the corrected Lean 4 code (include imports if needed):
